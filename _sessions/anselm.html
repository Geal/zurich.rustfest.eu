title: "Type-safe &amp; high-perf distributed actor systems with Rust"
desc: |
  Introducing a working prototype for a minimal actor-oriented system runtime to handle millions of actors and passed messages, across processor cores and even machines. It is written in and used from Rust. Using an additional code-generating build script, type-safe remote message sending and handling is magically desugared from plain Rust function calls and definitions, including dynamic dispatch with traits. This makes it possible to write complex, extensible distributed systems in idiomatic Rust.
