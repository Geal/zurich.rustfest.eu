title: "Impractical Macros"
desc: |
  A whirlwind tour through a (macro_rules 1.0!) macro that interprets everyone's favorite Turing tarpit, Brainfuck, completely at compile time. I'll highlight various components such as number encoding, arithmetic, input/output and explain how they work.

  This is not a macro tutorial. I'll cover a few techniques that you might possibly be able to use in real code, such as how to set up a recursive macro with an accumulator, but I'll be breezing through them to get to the fun stuff, like memory zippers and "Zermelo numbers" (a term I may have invented).
