title: "Antimony: a real time distributed stream processing system"
desc: |
  A real-time stream processing and distributed computation system written completely in Rust designed to out-storm storm and is heavily influenced by the [Twitter Heron paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2742788). Antimony addresses all the architectural and efficiency issues of storm just like Heron does however implemented in a much safer language and is not bound to be backward compatible with storm. we will explore the implementation of a cross-platform high performance / lightweight stream processing and distributed computation system in Rust backed by the full power of Tokio.rs
