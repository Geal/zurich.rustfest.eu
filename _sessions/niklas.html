title: "A Rust-based Runtime for the Internet of Things"
desc: |
  In this talk, I'll share my experience evaluating Rust as a basis for building Internet of Things (IoT) applications down to the bare metal.

  In principle, Rust's combination of memory safety and low runtime overhead makes it an ideal candidate for building IoT applications which currently are almost the exclusive domain of C and C++. As part of my master's studies, we ported Tock, an embedded operating system written in Rust, to a Bluetooth Low Energy SoC processor.

  In the end, we found that Rust is usable for building IoT applications with similar power consumption as production C implementations.
