title: "Create Rust games easily"
desc: |
  Ever wanted to make a game in Rust but didn't know where to start? Then ggez is the framework just for you!

  It bundles graphics and audio crates together with a simple API so can get started straight away.

  In this talk I want to walk you through the making of a game with ggez from empty boilerplate to publishing a playable game.
