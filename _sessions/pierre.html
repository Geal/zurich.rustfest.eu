title: "Mistakes to avoid when writing a wrapper around a C library"
desc: |
  Do you need to perform a certain task in Rust? Why not pick a mature C library that already does what you want, and write a wrapping library around it?

  Writing a wrapping library is sometimes not as easy as one could think, and you will probably make mistakes that will make you lose time or even make
  your wrapper unsound.

  This talk will show you the most common safety problems you may not have thought of, such as leak safety, but will also give you advices on what not
  to do when designing the API of your library.
