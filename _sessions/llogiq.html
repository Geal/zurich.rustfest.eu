title: "Rust In Rhymes"
desc: |
  This talk will take on a rather diverse set of topics, each outlined in limerick form. For each topic, a short explanation, also in rhymes (though not limerick meter), will follow where applicable. Slides will vary between code examples, rustdoc screenshots and memes.

  For example:

  > With `unimplemented!()` confess<br>
  > to your users the method is less<br>
  > than doneâ€“you can now<br>
  > add a message of how<br>
  > to deal with the unfinished mess.<br>
  > <br>
  > To delve a bit more into what's new<br>
  > PR 42155 brought to you<br>
  > the way to get your message through<br>
  > for things that you still intend to do.<br>
