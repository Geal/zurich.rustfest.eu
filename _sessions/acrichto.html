title: "Tokio: How we hit 88mph"
desc: |
  Async I/O has forever been a hot topic of discussion in Rust, but over the
  past year we've seen some significant advances in this domain with the
  `futures` crate an the Tokio project. We'll start off by taking a look at
  where we are today with the async I/O ecosystem in Rust, highlighting a number
  of the features we've added in both the libraries and the language over the
  past year. We'll then take a deep dive into Tokio itself and learn how it's
  just so darn fast and capitalizes and some of Rust's greatest strengths.
