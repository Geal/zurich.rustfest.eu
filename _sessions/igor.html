title: "Teaching an IDE to understand Rust"
desc: >
  IDE support is one of Rust's most requested features. From the 2017 State of Rust Survey: roughly 30% of Rust users are looking forward to IDE support more than any other feature in 2017 and for 22% of non-users, lack of IDE support is their main reason for not using Rust.

  In this talk, I'll cover what it took to support Cargo workspaces in the RLS and I'll explain how the RLS leverages
  existing tooling, including Cargo and the compiler. I'll demonstrate the current state of Rust programming with an IDE, and how you can benefit from using an IDE with your Rust projects.
