title: "Fearless concurrency in your microcontroller"
desc: |
  Fast, efficient, safe: pick three.

  Embedded systems are highly concurrent; they must respond to several different external stimuli within tight time constraints while maintaining a low power consumption. At the core of these systems we usually find microcontrollers, low end Systems on a Chip (SoCs) with just about enough resources to fulfill their tasks: tens of MHz of CPU frequency and a few KBs of RAM are usual.

  In this talk we'll explore how to do efficient multitasking on these systems using zero cost, memory safe abstractions.
